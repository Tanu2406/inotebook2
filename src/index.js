/*
This code is the entry point of a React application. It renders the React app onto the DOM (Document Object Model) at a specified root element.

import React from 'react';:

Imports the React library to define and work with React components.
React is necessary to write JSX (JavaScript XML), which allows mixing HTML-like syntax with JavaScript.
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';:

Imports ReactDOM to interact with the DOM.
ReactDOM.createRoot is a method introduced in React 18 to handle concurrent rendering.
import './index.css';:

Imports a CSS file (index.css) to style the application globally.
import App from './App';:

Imports the root component of the application (App), typically the parent component that contains other components.

document.getElementById('root'):

Selects the HTML element with the id="root" in the DOM. This is the container where the React app will be rendered.
Example from index.html:
html
Copy code
<div id="root"></div>

root.render():

Tells React to render the provided component (<App />) inside the root DOM element.
<React.StrictMode>:

A wrapper that enables additional checks and warnings during development (e.g., identifying deprecated APIs or detecting potential issues).
It does not affect the production build.
<App />:

The main component of the application. This is the starting point for defining the React component hierarchy.
